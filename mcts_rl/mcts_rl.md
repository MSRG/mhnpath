This phase aims to explore and implement Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods combined with reinforcement learning frameworks to strategize and optimize retrosynthetic pathways, factoring in cost, efficiency, and green chemistry principles.

#### To-Do List:
1. Investigate various MCTS approaches, identifying the most suitable for project goals.
   - **Target**: Evaluate and compare at least 5 different MCTS algorithms.
2. Design a reinforcement learning framework integrated with MCTS, inspired by relevant research.
   - **Target**: Develop a prototype framework based on the findings from "this paper".
3. Implement a scoring system leveraging the lookup dataset to assess pathway efficiency and alignment with green chemistry.
   - **Target**: Devise a scoring mechanism to rank pathways based on cost and green chemistry principles.
