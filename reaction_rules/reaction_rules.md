The extraction of reaction rules forms a pivotal part of the project, involving the automated derivation of rules from the collected datasets and the incorporation of manually determined rules from literature sources.

#### To-Do List:
1. Utilize datasets to extract reaction rules using RdChiral or similar methods.
   - **Target**: Generate a set of reaction rules from the collected datasets.
2. Gather manually determined rules from RetroBioCat and other literature sources.
   - **Target**: Compile a library of manually determined rules from credible sources.
