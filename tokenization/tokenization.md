The tokenizer segment evaluates transformer-based tokenization methods, aiming to identify optimal techniques for processing input data effectively.

#### To-Do List:
1. Experiment with tokenization methods as per the approach described in relevant literature.
   - **Target**: Compare and evaluate tokenization techniques mentioned in [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38347-2).
2. Explore Hugging Face's tokenizer algorithm as an alternative.
   - **Target**: Implement Hugging Face's tokenizer to assess its suitability for the project.
