The transformer architecture creation focuses on designing a robust model capable of predicting pathways using both standard chemical reactions and the enzymatic reaction database, integrating scoring based on cost, efficiency, and green chemistry principles.

#### To-Do List:
1. Develop a transformer architecture for pathway prediction, integrating both basic and enzymatic reaction data.
   - **Target**: Build a transformer model capable of predicting pathways with at least 90% accuracy.
2. Explore techniques to incorporate scoring based on cost, efficiency, and green chemistry principles into the transformer model.
   - **Target**: Develop a mechanism to score predicted pathways based on predefined criteria.
